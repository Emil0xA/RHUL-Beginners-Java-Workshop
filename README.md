Have you ever wondered how software is written?
Do you have a great software idea but you couldn't execute it becaue you don't know how to code? 

"Beginners Java Workshop" will cover all the basic knowledge you need to know to start coding. 
Even if you are not considering a technological path, programming is a great way to exercise creativity and logical thinking of your mind.
